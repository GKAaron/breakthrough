# breakthrough
This is a simple chess game by two players. The rules are:\
1.Players play alternating turns, and can only move one piece (of their own workers) at a time.\
2.In each turn, a worker can only move one square in the forward or diagonally-forward directions, as shown below. Moreover, a worker can 'capture' workers of the enemy team if they are placed diagonally forward from it, as shown in the illustration below. Note that if enemy workers are directly in front of the player, then a capture isn't possible.\

The two players have different strategies. One is offensive, the other is deffensive. The two players will use mini-max search and alpha-beta prune to 
try to find a best move for them in each turn. The text file is one result.
